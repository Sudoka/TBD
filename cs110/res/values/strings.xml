    <string name="types_info">        When it comes to wine, there are 5 main categories - Red, White, Rose, Fortified Wine, and Sparkling Wine. The catergorizing of wines comes from their difference in production methods which results in defferent taste and texture. The red wine has a slight bitter-ness to it because it is fermented with it\'s skin on, which is where the red color comes from. The white wine is sweeter because it is fermented without it\'s skin, which is the reason white wine is a light gold color. Rose is in between red wine and white wine in that it is left for a period of time with it\'s skin, but is then removed. Sparkling wine\'s sparkle comes from it\'s fermentation, usually in the bottle, in a large tank, or simply injected in. The carbon dioxide adds a slight amount of bitterness to it, but the sweetness of the, usually white or rose wine, covers it up. The fortified wines are wine which have other alcohols added to it, like port. It  usually have a higher alcohol content, and therefore less sweet, and comes with more of a kick.</string>
    <string name="title_activity_history">History</string>
    <string name="history_info"> Wine has been around since 7000BC. One of the more popular stories say that King Jamshid banished one of his harem ladies from his kingdom. Feeling sad, the she considered suicide, and found her way into the king\'s warehouse in search for poison. There she found a jar marked poison which was the remnants of grapes that had spoilt and deemed undrinkable. Little did she know was that the \"poison\" was actually fermented grapes. She discovered the effect after drinking to be pleasant and her spirits were lifted. She took her discovery to the king, who fell in love with the wine, and accepted the girl back into his harem. </string>
    <string name="title_activity_regions">Regions</string>
    <string name="regions_info">\tWine regions are regions that is recognized to be a major wine production region. Places with vineyards can apply to have it\'s location be labeled as a wine region but have to be approved. A location that is considered a wine region is not better than a location that is not, but it is more prestigious to have your location be considered a wine region.\n\tWine Regions are mainly catogerized into two categories - Old World, and New World. The Old World title is given to the countries that have been in the winemaking industry for a long time, such as Italy, Spain, France and others, while the New World title is given to the countries that are newer to the wine making business such as USA, Mexico and others. Old World and New World tells noting about the quality of the wine but from the difference in winemaking techniques, there are certain expectations from each of the categories. The five largest wine producing countries are China, USA, Italy, France and Spain. Within each wine region, there are usually smaller wine regions associated with it. For example, USA is a wine regions, within USA, California is a wine region, within California, Nappa Valley is also a wine region. All of them are considered wine regions.</string>
    <string name="title_activity_production">Production</string>
    <string name="production_info">Wine production is also known as winemaking, or vinification. Although wines are predominantly made of grapes, there are also wines made from honey, such a Mead. There are many different ways of making wine. \n\tRed wine is made from red grapes. The red grapes are juiced and left to ferment with yeast. The skins of the grapes are left to fement with it, giving it it\'s red color, and bitter taste. They are usually left to ferment in Oak barrels for 1-2 years before placed into bottle for distribution. \n\tWhite wines on the other hand are made of both white and red grapes. They are juiced and left to ferment without their skins on, resulting in their light golden color. They are usually left to ferment for 1 year, before bottled for distribution.\n\tRose is a mixture of the two. Rose is made of red grapes. They are juiced and left to ferment with their skins, but their skins are removed early on, giving it a more pinkish color. Rose are typically left for 1 year before bottled and sent for distribution.</string>

    <string name="title_activity_etiquette">Etiquette</string>
    <string name="etiquette_info"> \tThere are two main categories to Wine Etiquette - temperature and serving. It is very important to follow the corrent etiquette when wine is involved because it can drastically changes the experience of the wine.\n\tTemperature - Different wines are best served at different temperature. Temperature can effect the taste of the wine. For example, white wines are usually chilled before drinking to concentrate the sweetness of the wine, while red wines are usually drank at room temperature to allow the drinker to experience it\'s complexity in flavor. \n\nSparkling\t\t42-54 fahrenheit\t\t6-10 celcius\nRose\t\t\t\t48-54 fahrenheit\t\t9-12 celcius\nWhite\t\t\t\t48-58 fahrenheit\t\t9-14 celcius\nSherry(light)\t48-58 fahrenheit\t\t9-14 celcius\nRed\t\t\t\t\t57-68 fahrenheit\t\t13-20 celcius\nFortified\t\t\t57-68 fahrenheit\t\t13-20 celcius\nSherry(dark)\t57-68 fahrenheir\t\t13-20 celcius\n\n\tServing the wine is also a big part of the wine tasting experience. Red wine and Sherry(dark) wine are usually uncorked(opened) an hour early to allow the wine to air(oxidize) while sparkling, rose, white, and fortified are usually uncorked at time of drinking. Wines that need airing are sometime poured into a decanted (a glass bottle with a large mouth, and even larger body) which is designed to help the wine air. Choosing the wine glass is also an important part of the preperation. Wine that need airing usually goes well in wine glasses with really large mouth and bodies, a pear shaped glass, to allow the wine to air, while white wines and sparkling wine goes better with slim glasses to allow the wine to maintain it\'s cool temperature and sometimes to keep it\'s bubbles. After the preperation, pouring wine is also very important as red wines are usually poured down the middle of the glass to circulate the wine  while the carbonated wines are poured along the sides of the glass to keep prevent splashing, to protect it\'s bubbles.</string>

    <string name="foodpairings_info">Wine and food pairing have always been a very important aspect of enjoying wine. Wine can enhance certain food\'s flavors and vice versa. The idea is similar to drinking a very sour lemonade, and then drinking a sweet orange juice, the sour lemonade makes the sweet orange juice sweeter. People have been experimenting wines with foods to find good pairings. Many fine restaurants reccomend wines that go well with the food ordered to enhance the dining experience. Unlike other aspects of wine, wine pairing is relative. There are certain conventions when it comes to good food and wine pairings, but it is completely personal. When unsure, the conventions are good to fall back on, but finding your own set of wine and food pairing is much more important, and also much more fun.</string>
